# Driver-Distraction-Sytem

Lots of accidents are taking place these days because drivers are not attentive during driving so here is my project fro avoiding such cases which result in loss of life of driver as well as life of fellow passsenger inside the car. 


Above model is trained using yolov3-tiny and then inference model is used, crunching part of the project is that it is real time.

1:-Use of mobile phones during driving, it detects mobile phone while while having call on phone and also if someone continuosly watching screen during then, then is ,model will warn the user output in the form of speech("Please do not use mobile phone during driving")
